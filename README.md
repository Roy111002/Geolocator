# Geolocator

This geolocator is created using Python's "geocoder" library. It takes an IP address as an input and shows the location of that network, along with the latitude and longitude. It also plots the location on a map and stores it as an .html file in the same directory for easier access. It uses the "folium" and "ipaddress" libraries to achieve this result.
